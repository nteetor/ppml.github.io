	Important epidemiologic and policy changes that are reshaping national
	and local health landscapes necessitate a renewed focus on disease
	prevention and health promotion, and on strategic decision-making to
	prioritize programs for maximum impact and efficiency.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
    The Prevention Policy Modeling Lab models the health impact, costs and
    cost-effectiveness of infectious disease treatment and prevention programs
    in the United States. We work closely with collaborators in the <a
    href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/neema/index.html">National Center for
    HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP)</a> at the
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to inform U.S. health policy and
    guide public health decision-making at national, state and local levels.
    The models we build incorporate evidence-based prevention strategies,
    emphasize cross-cutting initiatives and produce results that can be
    operationalized within healthcare and other sectors.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
    The Prevention Policy Modeling Lab also builds web applications to
    provide user-friendly tools to our models. These tools visualize model
    outcomes and projections. This website is for the specific purpose of
    hosting and supporting these user-friendly tools. For further information on The
    Prevention Policy Modeling Lab, please see our <a

    website</a>.
