	Important epidemiologic and policy changes that are reshaping national
	and local health landscapes necessitate a renewed focus on disease
	prevention and health promotion, and on strategic decision-making to
	prioritize programs for maximum impact and efficiency.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
	The Prevention Policy Modeling Lab models the health impact, costs and
	cost-effectiveness of infectious disease treatment and prevention
	programs in the United States. We work closely with collaborators in the
	National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention
	(NCHHSTP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to inform
	U.S. health policy and guide public health decision-making at national,
	state and local levels. The models we build incorporate evidence-based
	prevention strategies, emphasize cross-cutting initiatives and produce
	results that can be operationalized within healthcare and other sectors.
