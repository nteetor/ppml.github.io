    This shortcut checks your package to make sure certain criteria are met (is
    <span class="font-weight-bold">e</span>verything okay?). These criteria
    range from a valid package name to proper S3 method declarations to
    NAMESPACE format. If you intend to submit your package to CRAN you need to
    be sure your package meets these criteria prior to submission. Furthermore,
    even if you do not plan to submit to CRAN, satisfying these criteria is
    probably a good idea as this will ensure others can successfully install and
    work with your package.
