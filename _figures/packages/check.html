    This shortcut checks your package to make sure certain criteria are
    met. These criteria range from a valid package name to proper S3 method
    declarations to NAMESPACE format. If you intend to submit your package to
    CRAN you need to be sure your package meets these criteria prior to
    submission. Furthermore, even if you do not plan to submit to CRAN,
    satisfying these criteria is probably a good idea as this will ensure
    others can successfully install and work with your package.
