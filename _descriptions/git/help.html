There are many git subcommands, they are the "add", "push", or "pull" you find
after the initial "git". While memorizing much-used subcommands like "add" or
"pull" is useful, you can always refer the git help summary for a list of common
subcommands.
  
Notice at the end of the summary a "help" subcommand is mentioned. This
subcommand can be used to learn more a particular subcommand.
