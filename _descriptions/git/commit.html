At this point you have added all your file changes or, in our analogy, written
down all your updates in the letter.

When you commit changes it is as though you are stamping and sealing your
letter's envelope. You have declared the letter complete (`git add --all`) and now
there is only one additional step to sending the letter on its way.
  
Adding a message to a commit is important. This will allow others to quickly
understand or give context to your changes. Always remember that future you is
one of those others! You may want to find a particular change and commit
messages will allow you to quickly skim weeks worth of work.
