Many of our projects will be bundled into an R package. This allows us to easily
share our methods and data in a standardized format. Installations are possible
from GitHub with `devtools` and packages will be made available on CRAN as
possible.

The default option to create an R package (no C++) is often enough. If you are
going to use C++ and Rcpp you might consider the second option here. If you do
not immediately need to work with Rcpp, but might in the future, you can always
add Rcpp infrastructure later with the `devtools` package.

When you know you are immediately working with C++ and Rcpp considering choosing
the second option. Remember, you can always add the necessary Rcpp
infrastructure to your project at a later time.

While most of the options here are easy to change later, updating a package name
is combersome and only gets worse over time. As you might imagine each time a
file mentions the package name a revision will have to be made. Package names
must only contain lowercase letters and number. While some package authors
include periods in their package names, please avoid this convention.

If you already have a set of existing scripts you want to build into a package
consider adding them here. The files will be copied into the new package's `R/`
folder. You might also have data you want to add, in which case you can select
`.rData` filest to add. These files will be copied over the package's `data/`
folder.

You may want to consider creating a high-level `git/` folder. Similar to a
Dropbox or Google Drive folder creating a git folder makes keeping track of all
your projects simpler.

When creating a new package make sure this option is selected. We could use also
use `git init` to add the necessary files to the package and project folder.
