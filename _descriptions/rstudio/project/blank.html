This is the final step when creating a new blank project. Most of the controls
on this screen are self-explanatory. However, click around to learn more about
recommended naming conventions or why that checkbox is supposed to be selected.

Project names follow file name conventions. Please separate words with dashes
and avoid using other symbols. Local folders and projects should be named after
their corresponding GitHub repository whenever possible.

Where you store a project on your computer is up to you. You might consider
creating a high-level `git/` folder to store all your projects which have a
corresponding GitHub repository.

This checkbox ought to be selected by default, but please double-check that it
is. Your new project folder will be created with all the files necessary for
git.
