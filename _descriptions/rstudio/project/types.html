There are a handful of options for a new project from scratch. We will focus on
the first two options as they are satisfactory for the majority of our work.

The first option is a blank new project. This is the most generic option and
good choice when starting out. Selecting a blank project now does not limit you
going forward. RStudio will detect if you add R package infrastructure files to
a project folder giving you the additional features talked about
[here](https://http.cat/404).

The second option is to create a new project with included R package
infrastructure. If selected your new project will contain a DESCRIPTION and
NAMESPACE file, R/ and man/ folders, and assorted other files. If you know your
scripts and data will eventually be converted into an R package this option is
for you. If you believe others will want to use your work or build upon your
work the R package option is also for.

The third option is to generate a new project with files relevant to Shiny
application development. These files, `server.R` and `ui.R`, usefully include a
small example for those getting started with Shiny or refreshing their
understanding of Shiny file structure.
