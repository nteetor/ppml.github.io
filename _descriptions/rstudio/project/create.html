When creating a new RStudio project you are presented with three options.

The first option is to create a brand new project and folder. This is handy
when starting from scratch. However, in some cases you may want to create a
new folder and project for your existing work. If you have a lot of excess
or obsolete files starting a new project may help clean up your file
structure

The second option is to convert an existing folder of files into a
project. This is the go-to option for existing PPML work.

The final option is to checkout a project from GitHub. If you work on
multiple computers this will allow you to pull down all your project files
to a new machine. If new persons will be collaborating this is how they will
go about getting your files. Be sure any new persons have been added as
repository collaborators, click

for steps on adding a new collaborator.
