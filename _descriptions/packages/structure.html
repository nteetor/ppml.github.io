<div class="flow-text">
  <p>
    Explore the folders and files of an R package by clicking on folders and
    files.
  </p>

  <div class="tab-content">
    <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="pkg-description">
      <p>
	The <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file contains information about your
	package. This includes information about you the author, links to any
	vignettes you might write, a list of other packages required to use your
	packge, and more.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pkg-inst">
      <p>
	The <code>inst/</code> directory holds miscellaneous files. Your package
	may need static files, scripts or libraries written in other programming
	languages, or other meta data not understood by the package structure.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The folders and files within the <code>inst/</code> folder are installed
	in the top-level of the package. Thus, to access these files within your
	package functions you can use,
	
	<div class="mb-3">
	  <code>system.file("&lt;file name&gt;", package = "&lt;package name&gt;")</code>
	</div>
	
	Notice that the <code>inst/</code> directory is excluded.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pkg-man">
      <p>
	The <code>man/</code> folders holds the package documentation files. The
	R documentation files may be written manually using a simple markup
	language. If you have ever worked with <span
	class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> you will find the R
	documentation markup language quite similar.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	However, instead of writing documentation files by hand, using Roxygen
	is highly recommended. From each block of roxygen, with a couple
	exceptions, a new file is created in the <code>man/</code>
	folder. Review the document shortcut above.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pkg-namespace">
      <p>
	The <code class="text-uppercase">namespace</code> file specifies which
	functions or variables are exported, made available to the programmer, and
	which functions or variables are imported from other packages.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Like your documentation files the <code
	class="text-uppercase">namespace</code> file could be edited by
	hand. However, again, roxygen is recommended. The <code>@import</code>
	or <code>@importFrom</code> and <code>@export</code> tags may be
	included in any roxygen block and, intuitively, import and export
	variables and functions. While these tags may be placed in any roxygen
	block, please organize your imports by creating a file, <code>R/&lt;your
	package name&gt;.R</code>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The file will look something like this. 
	<div>
	  <code>#' @import &lt;package name&gt;</code><br>
	  <code>"_PACKAGE"</code>
	</div>
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Place all your import tags in this file. For now, 
	The <code>@export</code> tag needs to be placed in each corresponding
	roxygen block.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pkg-r">
      <p>
	The <code>R/</code> folder contains all of your R scripts.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pkg-tests">
      <p>
	The <code>tests/</code> folder contains your package unit tests. This
	folder should be generated with <code>devtools::use_testthat</code>.
	Once created you will find a <code>testthat.R</code> file and a
	<code>testthat/</code> sub-directory within the new <code>tests/</code>
	folder.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The tests you write will go into the <code>testthat/</code>
	sub-directory. Writing tests is touched on in a separate section.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pkg-vignettes">
      <p>
	The <code>vignettes/</code> folder contains your package's long-form
	documentation, vignettes. Vignettes are an excellent way of introducing
	programmers to your packages. For now, see
	<code>?devtools::use_vignette</code>, more will come.
      </p>
