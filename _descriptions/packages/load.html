When working within RStudio the following shortcuts will greatly speed up your
package development cycle. You will be able to make changes without fear of
lingering out-dated functions or variables, quickly test changes against unit
tests, and build package documentation using Roxygen.

To use these shortcuts double-check that you have the latest version of the
devtools package installed, <code>install.packages("devtools")</code>.

Notice that many of these shortcuts use the first letter of their purpose,
i.e. the shortcut for <span class="font-weight-bold">d</span>ocumenting your
package uses the <kbd>D</kbd> key. All the shortcuts start with the
<kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd>.

You will most likey run the shortcuts in the presented order.
