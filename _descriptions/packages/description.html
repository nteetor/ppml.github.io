<p>
  The <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file contains basic information about your package.
  This information is specified by a predefined set of fields. Some of these
  headers are required, marked with a *, and others are only optional.
</p>

<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="desc-package">
    <p>
      The <code>Package</code> field specifies the name of your package. The
      name of a package must be at least two letters long, contain only letters,
      numbers, and dots, and start with a letter.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, you are encouraged to not use dots and to only use lowercase
      letters. Numbers are still allowed, but use them sparingly.
    </p>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-type">
    <p>
      The <code>Type</code> field specifies the type of the package. You will
      always specify the package type as <samp>Package</samp> and if this field
      is ommited the package type is assumed to be <samp>Package</samp>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-title">
    <p>
      The <code>Title</code> field gives a short description of the
      package. Because this short description is often displayed alongside the
      package name you are advised to exclude repeating the name in the
      description. The title should be written in title-case, i.e. capitalize
      principal words, but should not end in a period.
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic text-info">

  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-version">
    <p>
      The <code>Version</code> field specifies the version of the package. The
      default version is often <samp>0.1.0</samp>, but you are encouraged to
      start at version <samp>0.0.1</samp>. When a significant update to the
      package is made, be sure to bump the version number. Your first bump might
      be from <samp>0.0.1</samp> to <samp>0.0.2</samp>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Often, versions beyond <samp>0.1.0</samp> are considered stable. Those
      versions <samp>0.0.9</samp> and below could be considered alpha or beta
      versions. For finer control over your development versions consider
      starting with version <samp>0.0.01</samp>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When you release your package, you may consider bumping your
      package version to <samp>0.1.0</samp>. However, if you are publishing your
      R package, but still unsure of the toolset provided consider keeping your
      version below <samp>0.1.0</samp>.

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-author">
    <p>
      The <code>Author</code> field specifies who is the package author, first
      and last name.
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic text-info">
      * required (unless the Authors@R field is specified)
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-maintainer">
    <p>
      The <code>Maintainer</code> field specifies who is maintaining the
      package. As you can see in the example the field value is a full name
      followed by an email. Be sure the email is surrounded by angle brackets.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The maintainer serves as a point of contact for bug reports. See the
      <code>BugReports</code> field for more information.

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-author-r">
    <p>
      The <code>Authors@R</code> field may be specified instead of the
      <code>Author</code> and <code>Maintainer</code> field.
    </p>

    <p>
      The value of this field is R code and is one or more calls to
      <samp>person()</samp>. See <samp>?person</samp> for more
      information about the arguments. There are many many possible values for
      the <samp>role</samp> argument, but the roles you will most often use are,
