<p>
  The <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file contains basic information about your
  package. This information is specified by predefined fields. Some of these
  fields are required and others are only optional. Explore these fields by
  clicking on them in the example file.
</p>

<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="desc-package">
    <p>
      The <code>Package</code> field specifies the name of your package. The
      name of a package must be at least two letters long, contain only letters,
      numbers, and dots, and start with a letter.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, you are encouraged to not use dots and to only use lowercase
      letters. Numbers are still allowed, but use them sparingly.
    </p>

  </div>
  
  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-type">
    <p>
      The <code>Type</code> field specifies the type of the package. You will
      always specify the package type as <samp>Package</samp> and if this field
      is ommited the package type is assumed to be <samp>Package</samp>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-title">
    <p>
      The <code>Title</code> field gives a short description of the
      package. Because this short description is often displayed alongside the
      package name you are advised to exclude repeating the name in the
      description. The title should be written in title-case, i.e. capitalize
      principal words, but should not end in a period.
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic text-info">
      * required field
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-version">
    <p>
      The <code>Version</code> field specifies the version of the package. The
      default version is often <samp>0.1.0</samp>, but you are encouraged to
      start at version <samp>0.0.1</samp>. When a significant update to the
      package is made, be sure to bump the version number. Your first bump might
      be from <samp>0.0.1</samp> to <samp>0.0.2</samp>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Often, versions beyond <samp>0.1.0</samp> are considered stable. Those
      versions <samp>0.0.9</samp> and below could be considered alpha or beta
      versions. For finer control over your development versions consider
      starting with version <samp>0.0.01</samp>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When you release your package, you may consider bumping your
      package version to <samp>0.1.0</samp>. However, if you are publishing your
      R package, but still unsure of the toolset provided consider keeping your
      version below <samp>0.1.0</samp>.

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-author">
    <p>
      The <code>Author</code> field specifies who is the package author, first
      and last name.
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic text-info">
      * required field (unless the <samp>Authors@R</samp> field is specified)

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-maintainer">
    <p>
      The <code>Maintainer</code> field specifies who is maintaining the
      package. As you can see in the example the field value is a full name
      followed by an email. Be sure the email is surrounded by angle brackets.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The maintainer serves as a point of contact for bug reports. See the
      <code>BugReports</code> field for more information.
    </p>

      * required field (unless the <samp>Authors@R</samp> field is specified)

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-author-r">
    <p>
      The <code>Authors@R</code> field may be specified instead of the
      <code>Author</code> and <code>Maintainer</code> field.
    </p>

    <p>
      The value of this field is R code and is one or more calls to
      <samp>person()</samp>. See <samp>?person</samp> for more
      information about the arguments. There are many many possible values for
      the <samp>role</samp> argument, but the roles you will most often use are,

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-description">
    <p>
      The <code>Description</code> field is a long-form description of the
      package. You may be tempted to start the description with "&lt;package&gt;
      is &hellip;" or "This package is &hellip;", but CRAN asks you avoid doing
      so. Additionally, when writing the description bear in mind that the
      description is intended for R programmers of all levels and should be a
      single paragraph. An in-depth, technical explanation of your package may
      be more suited for a vignette.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any URLs specified must be wrapped in angle brackets (<samp>&lt;</samp>
      and <samp>&gt;</samp>). If you would like to wrap the paragraph's
      sentences onto new lines make sure each line is indented with 4 spaces.
    </p>

      * required field
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-url">
    <p>
      The <code>URL</code> field specifies one or more URLs associated with your
      package. If multiple URLs are specified they must be separated by a space
      or comma. If your package code is on GitHub be sure to include the
      repository URL.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be sure to include the scheme prefix, "http://" or "https://", in each
      of your URLs. Additionally, any spaces in a URL must be replaced with
      "%20".
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic text-info">
      * recommended field
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-bugreports">
    <p>
      The <code>BugReports</code> field specifies a single URL where bug reports
      may be submitted. Like the example here, if your project is on GitHub
      the bug reports URL should be the issues page of the repository.
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic text-info">
      * recommended field
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-license">
    <p>
      The <code>License</code> field specifies the licensing of your
      package. Specifying a license is important so others know how and when
      they may use your package.
    </p>

    <p>
      The R-project offers the following standard license shorthand
      specifications. Each shorthand is associated with a document outlining the
      copyright holder and the terms and conditions.

    <p>
      The last 3 licenses are templates and allow you to specify a copyright
      holder and year of copyright. When using a license template you must
      include a <samp>LICENSE</samp> file in your package's top-level directory
      (where the <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> file is) and append "<samp>+ file
      LICENSE</samp>" to the field's value. Each template
      outlines what information must be included in the <samp>LICENSE</samp>
      file.

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-encoding">
    <p>
      The <code>Encoding</code> field is necessary if your
      <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> file uses non-ASCII characters. Put another way,
      if you are writing your <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> file using only the
      standard characters on an English computer keyboard you do not need to
      include this field.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-imports">
    <p>
      The <code>Imports</code> field specifies which packages are used by your
      package. Any package from which you use a function must be included in
      this field. The only package which you do not have to list is the
      <code>base</code> package.
    </p>

    <p>
      The listed packages must be separated by commas, appear on separate lines
      starting below the field name, and must be indented by 4 spaces.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-suggests">
    <p>
      The <code>Suggests</code> field specifies 0 or more packages used in your
      package's examples, tests, or vignettes. Remember, a package should only
      be listed in one of <code>Imports</code>, <code>Depends</code>, or
      <code>Suggests</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The value of this field follows the same structure as the <code>Imports</code>
      field.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="desc-depends">
    <p>
      The <code>Depends</code> field specifies 0 or more packages to attach
      prior to attaching your package (via <code>library</code> or
      <code>require</code>). If your package's use case heavily incorporates
      functions from another package (think, only works in conjunction with
      these functions), then consider including the package in this field.
    </p>

    <p>
      A package may be listed twice in <samp>Depends</samp> to limit a package
      within a range of versions. When using the <samp>devtools</samp> or
      <samp>roxygen2</samp> packages you may see a a version of R automically
      added to this field.

    <p>
      The value of this field follows the same structure as the <code>Imports</code>
      field.
