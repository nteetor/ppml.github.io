    Often used RStudio keyboard shortcuts
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    When working within RStudio the following shortcuts will greatly speed up your
    package development cycle. You will be able to make changes without fear of
    lingering out-dated functions or variables, quickly test changes against unit
    tests, and build package documentation using Roxygen.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To use these shortcuts double-check that you have the latest version of the
    devtools package installed, <code>install.packages("devtools")</code>.
  </p>

  <h5>
    <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    This shortcut <span class="font-weight-bold">t</span>ests your package using
    the <code>testthat</code> package. If you are not familiar with unit testing
    or have not setup your package to use <code>testthat</code> you can skip
    this step, for now.
  </p>
    
  <h5 class="ruled">
    <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    This shortcut <span class="font-weight-bold">d</span>ocuments your
    package. The Roxygen blocks you have written will be built into documentation
    files. These files may be found in the top-level <code>man/</code> folder.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When building your package's documentation, any changed files will be
    listed under the RStudio Build tab. Look for <code>"Writing &lt;name of
    file&gt;"</code>.
  </p>

  <h5>
    <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    This shortcut <span class="font-weight-bold">l</span>oads your package. To
    begin with, you may think of loading as comparable to running
    <code>library(&lt;your package name&gt;)</code>.
  </p>
